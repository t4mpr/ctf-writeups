Welcome!  
This repository is a collection of my **CTF (Capture The Flag) challenge write-ups**, where I document the process, tools, and techniques I used to solve different security puzzles.  

The goal of this repo is to both **share knowledge** and **showcase my skills** in cybersecurity, reverse engineering, cryptography, and forensics.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each write-up has its own folder that contains:
- A `README.md` write-up in detailed Markdown format  
- Any supporting files (challenge files, scripts, screenshots, etc.)  

---

## 📝 Writeups

- [🎧 CTF Speaker](./ctf-speaker-writeup/README.md)  
  *A Bluetooth forensics + audio/Morse code decoding challenge. Flag hidden inside a waveform spectrogram.*

(More writeups will be added as I continue solving challenges!)
